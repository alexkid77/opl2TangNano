## Features

- **OPL2 Emulation**: Authentic FM synthesis from the iconic AdLib and Sound Blaster sound cards.
- **PWM Audio Output**: High-quality audio output using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).
- **I2C Integration**: Easy communication with external devices using the I2C protocol.
- **Retro Sound**: Brings vintage video game music and sound effects to life.
- **Clear Audio via I2S Codec**: Crystal-clear audio output for that nostalgic sound.

## Overview

This project implements the OPL2 chip emulation using an FPGA. The OPL2 chip is famous for its use in the AdLib and Sound Blaster sound cards from the '80s and '90s, which were known for their iconic FM synthesis sound.

The emulation is enhanced with PWM audio output and I2C communication, making it ideal for use with modern-day hardware, such as I2S codecs, for clear and accurate audio reproduction.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the provided instructions to configure your FPGA.
3. Connect an I2S codec to output the audio.
4. Load the design onto your FPGA and enjoy the retro sound!

## Prerequisites

- FPGA development board.
- I2S codec for audio output.
- Basic understanding of FPGA development.
